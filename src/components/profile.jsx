          this job was different. I had to understand how the power plant worked, including the measurement values for each operating mode.

          topic related to my bachelor's degree research on digital signal processing. My supportive team and this prior knowledge helped me a 
          lot. I learned to analyze machinery conditions through vibration patterns, temperature vision, and oil analysis. Feeling the machine 
          vibrations often indicated metal-to-metal impact, prompting further analysis by the mechanic supervisor. I also learned to balance 
          rotating equipment (single-plane balancing) and perform ODS (Operating Deflection Shape) analysis. Additionally, I created a website to 
          record measurements and trends, allowing easy access for everyone. My team and I also developed a simple software to make the balancing 
          process more efficient, saving time and reducing electricity losses. This was a wonderful and enriching experience.`,
