          forming a team with two other great people. This was my first English competition, and 
          it was very challenging. The competition had three stages: submitting videos of our speeches, 
          giving live speeches evaluated by Elsa AI and three company experts, and a grand final with a 
          live speech and debate. With support from our general manager and an experienced English tutor, 
          we were well-prepared. Our hard work paid off, and we won first place in the Team Category, 
          thanks to our teamwork and the support we received.`,

    desc: `I joined my company's prestigious Innovation Competition for the first time in 2020, invited by my 
          senior to address the real problem of belt swinging, which causes coal losses and potential fires. 
          Our idea was to automatically align the conveyor belt to prevent swinging. My senior, with a mechanical
          engineering background and five years of experience, designed a mechanical roller that didn't require 
          electricity, which we named Saber (Smart Belt Tracker). We successfully implemented it in our power 
          plant. Based on this success, we entered the competition and were thrilled to be top 10 finalists 
          nationally, even though the event was held online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Although we didn't 
          win first prize in the Technical Support category, the experience was unforgettable, and we remain 
          motivated to continue innovating for our company's future.`,
